### Creating conservation-sensitive, climate-smart fisheries closures for the ABNJ of the Pacific Ocean

Scripts that have been adapted are written/modified by multiple authors, all are part of the Mathematical Marine Ecology Laboratory of the University of Queensland, Australia:

* Kristine ("Tin") Buenafe (tinbuenafe@gmail.com)
* Isaac Brito-Morales
* Jason Everett
* Anthony J. Richardson

The sequencing of the `scripts` reflect the sequence of the workflow. Therefore, it is recommended to go through the scripts in sequential order to fully understand the workflow.

* `01`: creating the Robinson projected planning region
* `02`: creating the functions for intersecting conservation features with the planning region
* `03`: setting up bycatch layer using IUCN distributions
* `04`: setting up spawning grounds layer using data from Nishikawa et al. (1985)
* `05`: setting up climate layers
* `06`: setting up cost layer
* `07`: filtering planning region for the 'percentile' climate-smart approach
* `08`: creating climate-smart and climate-uninformed closures
* `09`: additional/optional scripts
